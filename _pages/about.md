It all started back in March of 2020. I had just rrecovered from an emergency surgery and was about to go back to the office.
Was cleared to start working on the the next Monday. That is when I found out I would not be going back to the office for a while.
I had just been laid off from my part time gig at abig box music retailer and the pandemic was shutting everything down. 

With no more perks, lots of extra time and an obsession with music and gear that has lasted for over 40 years. I would have to 
find another ways to satisfy my cravings. 



Worked at a big box music store for the last few.  After getting paid off I 
started building my own pedals when the pandemic started. 
Now that is an obsession as well. I am have Bi-Polar Dirorder and severe ADHD, but oddly enough no obsessive diorders.
This is my way of trying to connect with others. To learn and share shat I am learning.
