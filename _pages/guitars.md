I would like to just share the instruments I currently own and instruments I have owned in the past. I am not a great guitarist but I am learning. I started when I was 15 and have been trying to improve ever since. Back when I began it was difficult because I had injured my left arm and did not have feeling or movement in my pinky or half my ring finger on my fretting hand. This limited my playing and may be part of the reason I gravitated towards music that was dominated my power chords. 

Over the last 35+ years I have gained more feeling and use of that part of my hand and find that I am aable to play things that I was never able to play when I was younger. I had been enjoying that very much. This may be what has lead me to start getting everything that I had wanted when I was younger. Who knows?
