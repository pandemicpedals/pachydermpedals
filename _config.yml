  Pachyderm Pedals are hand wired pedals built in the USA from quality parts. 
  The line of Pandemic Pedals started when the pandemic did and I have building 
  ever since. I enjoy being able to create one of a kind hand painted pedals.

  bio    : "I'm a wee bit out of my mind. Been blasting Diary of a Madman and Crazy Train into my skull since the early '80s.
Been finding ways to deal with Bi-Polar Disorder and ADHD all my life. The pandemic introduced new challenges. That is what
lead me to start building pedals. A way to immerse myself into so many different creative activities. This is where I share
my creations and  the stories, successes, failures and what I have learned with others. Feel free to browse around. Let me 
know what I got wrong or where I might improve. Most of all I just hope you enjoy what I have created and can maybe gain 
some new insights."
