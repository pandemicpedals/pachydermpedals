This is my second 80's Jackson Randy Rhoads guitar. My first was a Jackson Rhoads that I bought from Sam Ash when I was a teen. It was stolen in the early 90s when I was taking a Greyhound bus from NY to Phoenix AZ. My original was a sparkle black. It was actually the same color of my first car. The first car, a Ford Festiva. You can see where my priorities were.

I found this guitar on Reverb and a decent price and jsut went for it after graduating college and getting a decent job. It really brought back memories. Hopefully I can get more picks up of the original when I get a chance.
