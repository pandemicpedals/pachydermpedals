Now this guitar is stupid expensive and I really have no idea why I bought it. It costs so much that I am afraid to take it out and play it. It just sits in the case most of the time. I really need to take it out and start learning some Satriani. Most of these purchases are because i worked at a guitar store and was able to get them ad or below dealer cost. I would never have purchased them otherwise.
