Now this guitar is stupid expensive and I really have no idea why I bought it. It costs so much that I am afraid to take it out and play it. It just sits in the case most of the time. I really need to take it out and start learning some Satriani. Most of these purchases are because i worked at a guitar store and was able to get them ad or below dealer cost. I would never have purchased them otherwise.

## Overview	

During their long partnership with Joe Satriani, Ibanez has released countless JS signature models. One of the most sought after has been the elusive Chrome-finished JS guitars, the Chrome Boy. Although immensely popular, the process to plate the 3-D curved body had been difficult to achieve at a manufacturing level, until now.

The Chrome Boy has arrived and it has everything a player needs and more. The JS 3-piece maple/bubinga neck provides stability and longer sustain. The rosewood fingerboard has Pearl dot inlays and 24 frets. The Prestige fret edge treatment allows for smooth playability.

The DiMarzio Satchur8 pickup in the bridge position assists in achieving a more versatile playing style and sound. The SUSTAINIAC Driver in the neck position is wired to the “Stealth PRO” preamp, specially customized for Joe. The SUSTAINIAC Driver creates endless sustain and expands the range of expression dramatically with a 3-way Sustainiac mode selector (Normal: Sustains the fundamental; Mix: Sustains the fundamental and overtone; Harmonic: Sustains overtone). The High-pass filter on the volume pot maintains highs at low volumes.

Also featured is the legendary JS/Edge Tremolo that delivers Joe‘s favorite feel and tone. The JS1CR also includes a special case to protect its unique finish from damage during transportation.
