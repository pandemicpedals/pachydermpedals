Charvel® once again ups the ante for modern high performance combined with elegant style and crushing tone with the Pro-Mod DK24 HSH 2PT CM, a stunning new instrument designed especially for a new breed of player whose musical vision and versatility knows no boundaries.

Its alder body in the classic Dinky style is dressed in either a lustrous Orange Crush or a no-nonsense Matte Army Drab satin finish. The two-piece bolt-on caramelized maple “speed” neck has graphite reinforcement, sculpted heel, heel-mount truss rod adjustment wheel, Luminlay side dots and a silky-smooth hand-rubbed urethane finish. Its 12”-16” compound-radius caramelized maple fingerboard features comfortable rolled edges, 24 jumbo frets, pearloid dot inlays and Graph Tech® nut.

Unbelievable full and versatile tone comes from a HSH pickup configuration consisting of a Seymour Duncan® Custom Full Shred SH-10B bridge pickup, Seymour Duncan Custom Flat Strat SSL-6 single-coil middle pickup and Seymour Duncan® Alnico II Pro APH-1N neck pickup, all with flat parchment covers. Other premium modern features include a five-way blade pickup switch, parchment Stratocaster®-style speed knobs for the volume (with 500K EVH® Bourns® low-friction potentiometer) and no-load tone controls, Gotoh® Custom 510 tremolo bridge, locking tuners, chrome hardware and more.br
