I knew what I wanted to do for the art on this pedal over 70 pedals ago. It just took me more than half a year to feel comfortable enough to attempt it. I talk alot at times about not worrying about being perfect and to just goi for it and do the things you want to do. Failure is not a bad thing. Things can be done again. But sometimes I fall to my uncertainty. That is why I chose this quote. It is also the quote on the Wampler site about the ["Cost of Tone Chasing"](https://www.wamplerpedals.com/blog/talking-about-gear/2017/12/the-cost-of-tone-chasing/).

## Thoughts

This pedal is **HEAVY** though. It has such a chug. I now need to make a dual footswitch version with the Boost and boost contour.

## Controls

* **Volume**
* **Gain**
* **Treble**
* **Mid**
* **Bass**
* **Hard/Brutal Toggle Switch**
