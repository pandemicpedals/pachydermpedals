## Build Report ##

This is a work in progress. I am planning to make this another in the line of Egyptian themed pedals. I have socketed the diodes so that I can change them out to have different sounds. Right now the classis KoT diode are on one side and common diodes on the other. Shells are much harder to work with than I thought.
