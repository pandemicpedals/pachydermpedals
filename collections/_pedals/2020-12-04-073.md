I am a big fan of flangers so I figured I would give this ia go. I believe it is my first programmed flange. Did the expression pedal mod on it too. Made mistakes but I will keep learning.

## Build Report ##

The first image shows the mod for the expression pedal. It is on the feedback potentiometer. So the pot is used when there is no expression pedal and when I plug in a cable it is bypassed. I will need to get some video and sound clips of it working.

You can also see in the fifth picture that there is a hole in the top. I wanted to top mount power but the PCb was in the way. I had to put it on the side. I will need to drill closer to the bottom if I am going to do this again. Or use a deeper enclosure. I may get one UV printed if I can get the pedal working well.

I would call this 70% done.
