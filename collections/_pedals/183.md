## Controls

* **Blend** - lets you mix your clean tone at the unity gain with the overdriven tone.
* **Level** - allows for further control of only the volume of the overdriven signal to finetune your preferred sound further.
* **Drive** - dictates how much saturation your tone should have. It goes from barely present to a tube pushed to its limits.
* **Era** - decide what kind of flavor your overdrive will have. Set it to minimum and youâ€™ll be taken back to the 70s, with the characteristic warm mid-range tones, while turning it clockwise will time travel you through more metallic sounding 80s, up to 90s rock sounds at the end of the dial.
