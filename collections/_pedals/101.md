This was almost a speed build of sorts. I already had the parts and the drilled enclosure. I just needed to solder everything up and put it together. It took me about 4 hours. I was lucky enough to have it work on the first try as well.

I really like this circuit. This is the second I have made and I think I am going to do another because I want to get the enclosure just right.

The art is a modification on a piece done by the artist Alex R. Kirzhner, "Hey Laserlips, Your Momma Was A Snowblower". I turned it into vector art and made some small modifications.

I believe this is his [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Artist/New-Shade-Of-Black-Alex-R-Kirzhner-690329601012923/) and his [website](http://www.newshadeofblack.com/). I always want artists to get credit. I really like his style.
Be sure to check him out.
