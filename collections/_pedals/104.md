I've already build this circuit once but I had an idea for a different graphic. I have been playing with the Tayda UV printing and wanted to give it another go. This one is not perfect as the whites did not come out the way I wanted. I will keep trying. I am going to put up a run of a few of these. We will see how it goes. I am very slow at selling pedals though.
