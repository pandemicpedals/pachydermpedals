excerpt: "Total experiment here. I forgot that I had already punch the positions for the holes and ended up putting the template on again in the other direction. This meant that I had a bunch of divots in the enclosure. I was trying to find ways to cover them. The string looked really need but was really hard to keep in place. Not sure how much I like the look. Pedal works great though."

## Build Report ##

Total experiment here. I forgot that I had already punch the positions for the holes and ended up putting the template on again in the other direction. This meant that I had a bunch of divots in the enclosure. I was trying to find ways to cover them. The string looked really need but was really hard to keep in place. Not sure how much I like the look. Pedal works great though.
