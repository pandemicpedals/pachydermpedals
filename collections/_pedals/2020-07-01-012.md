title: "Pandemic Pedal #012"
excerpt: "This is the first really big experimentation (at least for me). I wanted the pedals to have the knob coming out the side like the original. So I got a push/pull potentiometer and went to work. I made some mistakes and when trying to desolder from the board I just tore up the pad. Luckily with an audio proble and a wire I was able to get this to work and sound great."
