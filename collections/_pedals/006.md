I had a lot of trouble getting this pedal to work without the whining oscillation from the voltage pump. I really liked the sound but some chips got hot. Others were noisy. Finally got it sorted. Used AMANICMAN as a possible brand since I am bipolar.

I spent a lot of time on the look of this pedal. I did not like the wan the knobs were not evenly spaced, so I had to wire up the potentiometers so that I could adjust their locations. I also put the LED colors in the wrong order. I really wanted the red on the left but will live with what's there now.

I also painted the compass on the front twice because I messed up the first one when I did not like the clear coat I used. You can actually see the face go from frowning to smiling. Then again maybe it was a subconscious manifestation of my moods. Who knows? And that nasty brown that can be seen on the inside is the original top coat I tried to burn off. I ended up using epoxy for a finish. I liked the way it got rid of the cracking on my paint job. That is also why it has a v1.5 on the enclosure.
