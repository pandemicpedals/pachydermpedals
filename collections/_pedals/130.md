I've been wanting to build all the ENGL pedals I can since getting an ENGL powerball. When I saw that PCB Guitar Mania had the 530 preamp I knew this was gonna be one of the first I built.

## Art

I thought the ENGL led itself to grafitti really well. I did a quick sketch and liked it. I looked at some grafitti online to get an idea of how they did it and how it was colored. I think it lends well to paint pens. I cannot blend but i can get the different blocks of colors.
