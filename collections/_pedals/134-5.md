THe guts for these rwo pedals are taken from 117 & 118. Madbean does not have the PCBs in stock at this time to get another set. But this is my proof of concept to see if I can make prints of my hand painted pedals. 

I think this will be my workflow from now on: 

* Paint the enclosure before I  drill holes and do not label it.
* Create high resolution scan of painted image.
* Transform image into vector art
* Add labels, logo and indicators
* Have UV prints done
* Steal underwear
* ...
* Profit

This way I can make them available to those who would like to have one and I can keep the originals for my decendents :). 

## Controls

### Right Half

* **DIRT**: Sets the distortion volume at the output.
* **CLEAN**: Sets the clean signal volume at the output.
* **DRIVE**: Total gain, from “warm” to hard-edge distortion.
* **GATE**: This control allows you to dial out noise. CCW - no gate and the distortion is wide open. CW: as you turn it up it will first eliminate hiss and noise at the highest Drive settings.  he further up you go it starts squash the dynamics into a highly gated response.
* **S/H**: Left: soft clipping (op-amp distortion). Right: hard clipping (op-amp distortion plus LED clipping).

### Left Half

* **PITCH** - Sets the frequency of the swept filter from low to high.
* **SMOOTH** - Sets the length of the swept filter. CCW is short (“jerky”) and CW is long (“smooth”).
* **SQUELCH** - Adjusts the resonant peak of the swept filter. CCW is low resonance (“subtle”) and CW is high (“mayhem”).
* **SWEEP** - Determines the range of the swept filter. CCW is narrow, CW is wide.
* **D/U** - Determines the direction of the filter. Left is down, right is up.
