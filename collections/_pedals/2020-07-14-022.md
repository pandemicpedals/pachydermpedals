## Build Report ##

**Edit:** [Feb. 14, 2021] I built this in July of 2020 using the Madbean PCB. I purchases the actual pedal in January of 2021. I will be making a comparison demo at some point over the coming months. 
{: .notice--info}

I plan to make this one again. When I do I think I will try making my own board or use vero as I want to use all 9mm plastic pots so that It will take up less space and I can put some real art on it. Great gain pedal.
