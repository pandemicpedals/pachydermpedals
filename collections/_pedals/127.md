This was almost a speed build of sorts. I already had the parts and the drilled enclosure. I just needed to solder everything up and put it together. It took me about 4 hours. I was lucky enough to have it work on the first try as well.

## Controls

From the [solodallas shop](https://solodallas-shop.com/products/storm-d-2019):

* **GAIN** knob controls our signature gain circuit that bumps the crucial low-mid frequencies responsible for giving live instruments punch and making them stand out in the mix (think Angus Young guitar tone).
* **BOOST** knob controls a powerful pre-amp capable of delivering a whopping 31db of clean boost. This analog boost is perfect for making lead parts stand out, adding fullness to the signal going into the front end of your amplifier or pushing it into oblivion!
* **LIMITER** knob controls Ken Schafferâ€™s signature Opto-Isolator limiter. This optical analog circuit naturally limits the audio signal going into the pedal's circuitry (unlike the complimentary compander circuit which smooths out amplitude after the signal reaches its peak). Limiting is commonly used by mastering engineers to transparently raise overall level, without the risk of clipping and distortion generally associated with gain increases. Sensitivity of this effect may be fine tuned for different output pickups or to give your instrument an open or compressed attack.
