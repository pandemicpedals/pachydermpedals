title: "Pandemic Pedal #041"
excerpt: "This I always wanted to be a ripoff of the original design. But I graduated in 1987, so I had to change the year. I also had to wire the 3rd knob off board and the controls aren't in the same place as the original. Great sounding pedal. One day I will get the email letting me know I can order one."
