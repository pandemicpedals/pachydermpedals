This is the first pedal in what I am considering the Madbean Gauntlet. That is the `Super Genius` ans `Zeus` level builds on Madbean's website. This build is different from more basic build because you use a tube and some capacitors and resistors that are not in the typical pedal.

* 6011 Tube
* 5W Transistor
* Silver Mica Capacitor
* Long leg right angel 16mm potentiometers

A change I would like to make to the build is use diffused LEDs for interior. I used super bright blue led for the inside and it does not dispurse the color throughout the interior of the pedal.
