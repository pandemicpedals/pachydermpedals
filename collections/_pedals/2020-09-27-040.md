excerpt: "This is the first pedal I have done with an Aion board. It sounds good and the instructions were easy to follow. I ended up with a great sounding pedal. And due to RTFM (Reading the instructions first) I saved myself the hassle of having to desolder the DPDT on-on-on switch. Who know that they came in 2 different varieties. And I had the wrong one."

## Build Report ##

This is the first pedal I have done with an Aion board. It sounds good and the instructions were easy to follow. I ended up with a great sounding pedal. And due to RTFM (Reading the instructions first) I saved myself the hassle of having to desolder the DPDT on-on-on switch. Who know that they came in 2 different varieties. And I had the wrong one.
