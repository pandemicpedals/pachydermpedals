## Demo

{% include video id="C9QYGaH2xKs" provider="youtube" %}

## Controls

* **Rate** – Controls the speed of the LFO which drives the flanger effect.
* **Range** – Controls the overall depth of the flanging effect.
* **Fdbk** – This is the amount delay line signal sent back to the input of the BBD. Higher levels of feedback increase the complexity of the flanged signal and can yield some intense, airplane flanging.
* **Filter** - This DPDT switch disconnects the LFO for a mild to moderate ring-modulator effect. This effect can be influenced with the Range and Feedback controls.

### Trimmers

* **Vol** – This is the output volume of the added gain stage at the end of the effect.
* **T1** – Sets a limit on the maximum amount of Feedback possible.
* **Clock** – Sets the correct voltage to run the oscillator through the clocks which drive the BBD delay lines.
* **Bias** – Sets the correct voltage bias to the input of the BBD.
