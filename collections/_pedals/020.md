I implemented a mod from a build on the PedalPCB forum. I liked the added option of parallel/series that he did so I added that to mine. This was a fun and challenging build. I believe I also labeled it horribly wrong. I like my elephant on this one, I think it integrates the Mu-Tron logo well.

## Controls

* **Rate A** – Sets the LFO speed of Phaser A
* **Depth A** – Sets the LFO depth of Phaser A
* **Feedback A** – Sets the regeneration of Phaser A
* **Rate B** – Sets the LFO speed of Phaser B
* **Depth B** – Sets the LFO depth of Phaser B
* **Feedback B** – Sets the regeneration of Phaser B
* **Sync** (Toggle switch) – Sets the LFO syncronization of Phaser B (Normal / Reverse)
* **Sweep** (Toggle switch) – Selects the LFO source of Phaser B (LFO A / LFO B)

Additional:

* **Series / Parallel** - Set the path as A into B or A & B in parallel.
