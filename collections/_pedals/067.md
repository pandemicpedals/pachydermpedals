excerpt: "This is so I can A/B originals vs. clones when I have the orig available. Or just to A/B two pedals against each other. My only mistake is that when you flick the switch right it is the left hand loop and vice versa. The leds light up correctly. So at least I have that going for me."

## Build Report ##

This is a common circuit and has no electronics for the audio signal, just the LEDs.

This is so I can A/B originals vs. clones when I have the orig available. Or just to A/B two pedals against each other. My only mistake is that when you flick the switch right it is the left hand loop and vice versa. The leds light up correctly. So at least I have that going for me.
