We had been talking about is we could do a blackout pedal enclosure using Tayda's UV printing on the [PedalPCB Forum](http://forum.pedalpcb.com/). So I put this together real quick and got it out the door.

I know it is not a total blackout. There is that little smudge in the middle. That is a rat fetus. With this being a clone of the Life Pedal which itself is a modified clone of the Rat, i thought it was an appropriate graphic. I hope you enjoy.
