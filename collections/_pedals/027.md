With the original being the dirt transmitter and the clone being the cross contaminator I wanted to draw the bio hazard symbol. I just knew that I would have too much trouble recreating all those circles. So I chose the radiation symbol instead. I like the way it came out with that sludgy looking contaminated, dirty interior.
