## Controls

* **Volume**
* **Gain**
* **Tone**
* **Damping** - Overdrive pedal from that mysterious Carl Martin dude, and it comes with a Damping control. You switch over to the Panama, crank the Gain, increase the damping and your distortion becomes even more aggressive, more cutting and clear…just like….well you know. Decrease the damping, and your distortion becomes deeper, thicker with more bass dynamics.
