This was another attempt to get the UV printing right. I made a mistake with the spot colors (Tthey weren't) and the gray is what I got instead of the shite I wanted. I consider this a happy accident because I really like the say the gray looks behing the image. I still want the labels to be white in the final draft of this though.

## Controls

* **Rate**
* **Depth**
* **Lag** - The Lag knob lets you set the center delay time that the LFO modulates around. From smooth tight modulation at lower settings, to noisy nauseating detune at maximum, the Lag knob adds a new dimension to the traditional Chorus/Vibrato landscape.
* **D-C-V Blend** - The Dry-Chorus-Vibrato Blend changes the ratio of dry to wet signal sent to the output. At minimum, you will hear no effect. Set it to noon for equal parts dry and wet – the traditional chorus setting. Set it to maximum for 100% wet – the traditional vibrato setting.
* **Wave Switch** - The Wave switch lets you select either sine or triangle LFO waveforms. The sharper corners of the triangle wave generally sound more appealing for chorus type effects, and the more round shape of the sine wave generally sound better with vibrato type effects.
