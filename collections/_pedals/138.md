I like the challenge of pedals with SMD spots for the J201 trasistors. I have a bunch but I am saving those for breadboarding and circuits that need them.

# Art

When I was using the tweezers for the SMD I knocked them off the table and went to catch them. This of course got me stabbed in my finger. I know some people think it is sik but I have always been facinated by my own blood. So As I bled I wiped it on one of the white enclosures.

After that I though the smear looked like a tearing eye. So I decided to doodle around the blood.

When id dried it was not as red as I had hoped and the drip turned black and got really dry and cracked. It is still encased inn the epoxy, at least what is left. i think it is fitting for a red pedal though. &#128540;
