excerpt: "I made a couple of posts to get opinions on knob color and LED placement. I wanted the LED to be subtle. And while the red \"magpie\" knobs from Love My Switches looked great and were the most suggested, I felt that distrated from the organ. I really love painting these pedals."

## Build Report ##

I made a couple of posts to get opinions on knob color and LED placement. I wanted the LED to be subtle. And while the red "magpie" knobs from Love My Switches looked great and were the most suggested, I felt that distrated from the organ. I really love painting these pedals.
