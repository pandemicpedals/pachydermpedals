That beetle. The full article will have all the info that went into building that beetle. I think it took me about a month to get it to where I was satisfied. As with the other egyptian themed pedal, I used phoenician letters for the labels and Egyptian art. I have a few more on the way. All on Tayda copper hammer enclosures.

## Build Report ##

Playing around with coloring epoxy

Figured I pour and draw on the epoxy at first.

Got a bright idea while working on another pedal. Made from the lead clippings.

Welp.... lets paint it. First in black then the gold over it.

Check against the  concept.

Initial Colors

Shading and a little detail

Decided to cut and shape the pour into insets with bailing wire.

Really hard to solder. Was considering doing the legs as well.

Completed frame. I had to wire it to a vero board to keep it together for soldering.

Test fitting the pieces

Awe heck lets just put it together and see.

Changed the light to a copper shield. I liked the way  it fit and looked better.

Epoxied the beetle when finishing some other pedals. I like the way the colors come out.

Completed with everything epoxied down.

Sounds good. One of my favorite fuzzes so far.

Egypt pedals on
