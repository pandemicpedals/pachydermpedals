excerpt: "This is the first build to really frustrate me. I actually took the pedal and threw it in the trash after soldering the 2P4T on the wrong side of the board. Literally had a little hissy fit. I got over it though. Fished out the PCB and got to work removing the switch. It was destroyed in the process but the pedal work and sounds great now. Or at least as great as this pedal can sound. "
