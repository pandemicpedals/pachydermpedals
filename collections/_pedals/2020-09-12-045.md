excerpt: "For me AT+ meant AT + AT, hence the AT-AT. I was worried about trying to paint something with so much detail, so small. I felt I did a passible job. The best friend asked why the AT-AT has boobs. I thought it was just his crazy dirty mind. That was until someone on social media asked the same question. I need to get better at perspectives. That clear knob blends in really well though."
