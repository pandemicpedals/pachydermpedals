## Build Report ##

I had nothing to do with the art for this pedal. I could not improve on this. I really like MAS Effects chosen art and he was good enough to include the sticker with my partial kit. I have been having fun playing with the sounds this has. I am going to use it to learn more about digital pedals. The only indication that it is made by me is the elephant on the bottom of the pedal instead of the MAS.
