excerpt: "[First Point to Point Pedal Build! I liked theidea of having a pedal that could do the LOFI sound of an AM radio. I kept seeing this schematic and with so few pieces just put them together point to point. I added an options I read about online for different capacitors and like the sounds it makes. It really gets spitty dial all the way right."
