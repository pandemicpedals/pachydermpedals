This is my first build from Skidmark pedlas. I have purchased all of his pedals to date. I like that he provides the graphics and all for the builds. It allows me to create a skidmark pedals with my personal customizations. This is my second UV printed pedals and the first with a PDF U created myself. I did not get any gloss or matte finish and that was a mistake. I would get the finish next time to protect the graphics. The color comes off easily without any protection.

As for the pedal itself, it is a great bi-chorus. I love the range of sounds that I can get out of it. Like most pedals I need to spend more time with it.
