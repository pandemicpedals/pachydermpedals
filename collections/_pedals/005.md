This is the first pedal to get painted. I thought the scribbled Union Jack would be easy. I was wrong. The name \"Plexi blah blah blah\" is an indication of my frustration of not knowing how to paint with the pens.

This is also the first time I took a little artistic license with the electronics. It is only putting in 3 LEDs instead of one but it was new for me. Not actually following the instructions.
