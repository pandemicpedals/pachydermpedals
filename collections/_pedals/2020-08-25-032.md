excerpt: "I don't know if any of you have seen happy on Netflix. It is a raunchy show about an imaginary friend names Happy. In the second season Happy has his first intimate encounter with Bo-Peep, another imaginary friend. During his climax he ejaculates rainbows from his unicorn horn. What better way is there to represent a rainbow machine."
