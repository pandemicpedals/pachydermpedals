After seeing the LED layout for the rotary switch I felt they looked like the small eyes of a Wolf Spider. I like taratulas, they are cute, so I figured that would make good art for this. I am really happy with the way it came out. Though I really do not like pedals without labels for the controls, I could not think of a good way to label the controls with out messing up the picture. I put the controls on the inside of the cover so that the user would not be completely comfused as to what the knobs do. (The user probably being me)

You can also wee the road sign I use as a template to solder on the offboard parts before I put the circuit in the enclosure.
