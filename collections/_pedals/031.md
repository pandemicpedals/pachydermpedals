## Build Report ##

I love elephants, and I have always planned to put the Muzzle in a black sand enclosure. I was originally gonig to create a different image using multiple layers of epoxy to form a 3D image. My tests told me it would be too thick. So I now have another theme. Skulls on the black sand. For this I felt the elephant skull worked really well.
