Another enclosure that had an image but no circuit. I had drawn this little guy in my sketchbook and as I sat around one morning at my brothers house I got out my paints and put it to powdercoat. I really need to find a good way to translate pen and sharpie to the enclosures. The paint pens do not have the shading ability of a pen or the thinness of a sharpie. I will get better with time though. 

When I got home I felt the glory hole best fit the asthetic of this art. Looking into the glory hole to see what's inside.
