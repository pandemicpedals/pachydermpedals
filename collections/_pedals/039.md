title: "Pandemic Pedal #39"
excerpt: "This is the same as Pandemic Pedal #10. I do not have that pedal any more as that is my first sale. Sold to a friend that I have played \"The Last of Us: Factions\" with for years. He loves the sound of it. His has a yinyang like the original. For this one I wante to do something different so I painted the budha. I like these colors alot."
