excerpt: "That beetle. The full article will have all the info that went into building that beetle. I think it took me about a month to get it to where I was satisfied. As with the other egyptian themed pedal, I used phoenician letters for the labels and Egyptian art. I have a few more on the way. All on Tayda copper hammer enclosures."
