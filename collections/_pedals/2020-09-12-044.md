title: "Pandemic Pedal #044"
excerpt: "I felt baby blue and pink would be good colors for this pedal. I have been working on the internet for 25 years. Damn I'm old and have seen every meme over that time. Everything from ermahgerd, overly attached girlfriend, and goatse to nyan cat. For this painting Nyan cat fit my color scheme best. It also got the sparkle treatment. "
