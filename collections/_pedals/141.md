This is a high gain metal machine. I can get some really great Cowboys from Hell tones out of this. And if you switch it over to the tight rock setting you can get some really nice 80s metal tones. It is a very versitile pedal to rock out with.

## Art

Another in my series of skulls on the black sand textured enclosures. This time it is a warthog.I should have paid attention to what circuit I was going to put in so that I positioned is a little better. This is also one of the more difficult skulls to get the depth correct.
