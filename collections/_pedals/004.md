This was just a straight build. A fun high gain pedal and the start of many many Eartquaker Devices builds. I had just stopped working at a music store and was still waiting for a large order of pedals from EQD. I figured I would build the pedals I did not order. Building is like paint by numbers. As long as you follow directions everything works out. This was no exception. 

## The Art

[![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pedals/004/Talons.jpg)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pedals/004/Talons.jpg){: .align-right .width-150}
Even though this is pedal #4 this is actually the 4th that I tried to do a serious paint job on.

I was still staying in line with copying the look of the original with a little spin. I started searching the web for pictures of talons. I was also starting to play round with Inkscape. Here is the progression of me trying to find a good level of detail to imitate. I learned to use the trace bitmap feature. I do multiple scans with the number of colors I think I will have in my paint pen collection. Usually 8, 12, or 16.

## Controls

* **Treble**: Noon is flat, boost is clockwise from noon, cut is counter clockwise from noon.
* **Middle**: Noon is flat, boost is clockwise from noon, cut is counter clockwise from noon.
* **Bass**: Noon is flat, boost is clockwise from noon, cut is counter clockwise from noon.
* **Presence**: Adjusts the top end and upper mids to control the amount of “sizzle” in the dirt. Turn clockwise for a brighter tone, counter clockwise to mellow it out.
* **Gain**: Preamp volume control. Controls the amount of dirt available, from clean to heavy crunch.
* **Level**: Master volume control. There is a lot of level on tap, please adjust accordingly.
