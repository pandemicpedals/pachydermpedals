excerpt: "This is not finished. I want to make little copper or aluminum plaques for the controls. Then epoxy coat the entire thing. This is also the first and only pedal I have painted so far. I used a pewter hammer texture paint and a nice blue. I put alternating layers to get this effect. I play to epoxy coat the plaques onto the top when it is finished."
