As soon as PedalPCB came out with the concept for this PCB I know I wanted to make a window for this pedal. When it arrived and I read the instructions I decided that I would make it an art piece. All the components are twisted to form the spikes on the virus. There is an always on blacklight LED in the pedal and a 10mm green LED to indication when it is active. This thing really glows on a pedalboard.

## Concept

* I wanted the components to be part of the virus. I need to be sure not to cross any of them up.
* I need to get a vacuum chamber to get all the bubbles out the epoxy before I pour.
* The window is epoxy with plexi-glass backing. I was worried the epoxy would sag over time.

## Installation

This is all that is left on the correct side of the board. Notice the pots needed to be crossed up because they are mounted on the wrong side. I still used the center pin so that I could hold up the PCB.

## Lighting

* The UV LEDs are always on as long as the pedal is plugged in.
* The indicator LED is a 10mm Green that shines down from the top of the face.

## View of Interior

Some different angles of the interior of the pedal.
