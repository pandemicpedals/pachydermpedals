I find this pedal difficult to use. There are so many options I am never sure what to do. To be fair though I have not spent a lot of time with it, neither have I labeled all the switches and knobs so I don't even know what to do with them. The build was fun and interesting, All the switches make it kind of hard to wire up. 

I am waiting to get my CNC setup for laser etching. When I get that done I am going to label this pedal then I will give it a little more time.
