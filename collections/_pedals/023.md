My interpretation of the RKO radio tower. This was a lot of fun to build. It was hard to find 120uF electrolytics that would fit. I think it was worth it in the end though.

## Build Report

Notice the red sinks into the other paint during baking because the pigment is heavier. If I want a vibrant red I need to add it after baking and before epoxy.

## Controls

* **Gain Trim** – Controls the gain of the unit
* **Low Cut** – Attenuates low frequencies
* **Level** – Controls the overall output volume
* **Gain** (Toggle Switch) – Select low or high gain mode
