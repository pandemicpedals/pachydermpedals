## Build Report ##

This is only my second vero build. It is a mainstay on my board. I will have to compare it to the B3K and the B7K Ultra when I get a chance. I love the sound for bass. Very versitile.

### Overview

I went looking for the vintage microtubes schematic after I purchase the Darkglass B7K Ultra. I believe they make some of the best modern bass pedals. I finally came across a the vero on a [forum](http://guitar-fx-layouts.42897.x6.nabble.com/Darkglass-VMT-td16443i40.html). After ready the thread and see the discussion over the circuit I decided to go with the layout put together by ξεναγος νεκροπολης.

It was a very straight forward build. Easy to source parts that I happened to have on hand. I am really glad I gave it a shot. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good bass pedal.
