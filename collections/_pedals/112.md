When I first saw the name for this I thought it was going to be a fuzz or distortion. Never thought is was gonna me a delay.

## Thoughts

First attemp at a doodle on a pedal. The clear coat paint changed the color of the red sharpie. Looks rusty now.

## Controls

* **Time** - Sets the delay time (approximately 30ms â€“ 625ms)
* **Repeats** - Sets the delay line regeneration from a single repeat to full on self-oscillation
* **Tone** - Adjusts the tone of the delayed signal
* **Mix** - Sets the output level of the effected signal
