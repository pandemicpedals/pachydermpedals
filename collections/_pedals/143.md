This was built for my landlords daughter. They have a traditional Greek wedding band and she plays the bass. She is unfamiliar with pedals and I thought a compressor would be a godo introduction and something that she could use.

# Art

See send me a picture of a broach that she had on her guitar strap and said that is what she wanted as the art. This is my attempt to replicate it with paint pen. I am happy with the say it turned out. 

## Controls

The 2 knob compressor what a really good choice and it sounds and works really well.

* **Compress** – Controls the amount of compression
* **Volume** – Controls the overall output volume
* **Gain** (internal trim pot) – Adjusts the internal preamp gain
