This is the first really big experimentation (at least for me). I wanted the pedal to have the knob coming out the side like the original. So I got a push/pull potentiometer off of Reverb and went to work.

### The Push/Pull

In the first two pictures you can see what I was hopeing would work. Solder the switch part and have the lugs loop over and solder them to the pads. Well I did this and it was wrong. Lugs one and thess were backwards. With what I know now I can see it just by looking but when I was putting it together I was much less knowledgable. I now know that the square hole is for lug one and that lug one is one the left when looking at the potentiometer in this position.

That means I had to desolder the gus and run wires that criss-crossed to the proper holes. I made some mistakes and when trying to desolder from the board I just tore up the center pad. Luckily with an audio proble and a wire I was able to get this to work and it sound great. That is why the output is not coming from the pad at the bottom (Left in picture 3) of the PCB.
