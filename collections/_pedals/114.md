As soon as I saw that PCB Guitar Mania made this I know it was going to be one of the first PCBs I built from them.

## Thoughts

I wish I had seen the high gain options before I added the boost, but that just means that I will buy it again and build another.

## Controls

* **Volume**
* **Treble**
* **Mids**
* **Bass**
* **Gain**

### Add-ons

I added a LPB-1 boost to the beginning of the circuit. It is only active when the pedal is not in bypass.

* **ON/OFF Switch** - Up is on. There is no other indicator.
* **Level** - That tiny white think is a trimmer that is sticking out of the enclosure near the stomp. You can dial the boost up or down.

I find this works best with some EQ before the pedal or it sounds a little muddy.
