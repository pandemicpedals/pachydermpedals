## Build Report ##

This is the first of the Rullywow boards I started to put together. All parts were self sourced from [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/), [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/), [Love My Switches](https://lovemyswitches.com/), [Pedalhacker Electronics](https://www.pedalhackerelectronics.com/default.asp), and more. It was not the first for me to paint. That actually came months later but it is one of my favorites to play. I really like the smooth mellow sounds I get out of this.

I didn't finish the art and the epoxy until 3 months after the pedal was built. The enclosure is a Tayda cream powder coat.

### Art ###

* The look when originally finished. Was testing knob colors.
* Used pencil, rulers and a compass to try to get nice even round design.
* Pre-epoxy coat. I learned to pay attention to the washers for the pots. I no longer allow the sharp side to be down.

### Epoxy ###

All shiny with the epoxy on. This is before re-drilling the holes to remove the epoxy. I had tried plugs in a previous pedal but the epoxy pulls up against the plug and makes divots around the knobs. I like the smooth surface that taping and filling the holes gives me.

I did not do a great job keeping the epoxy on the top. This is something I am still working on. My first few pedal had the DC and jack labeling on the end. After the first 5 or 6 I stopped doing that.

### Assembly ###

* I now label in/out/9v at the top. Here holes are drilled and it is ready to assemble.
* This is the second pedal I soldered. I was still very new and I was using lead free solder. Leaded I learned is much easier to use.
* Gut shot. After the first few pedals I stopped using the Madbean method of wiring the stomp and now use the PedalPCB method. I like the look better and find it easier.

### Finished ###

This has been one of my early favorite pedals. I really liked the sounds that came out of it. They were so different from the Heavy Metal that I am used to playing.

### Extras ###

These are some of the "flaws" in the finish of the pedal. I kind of like the drips. I like that nothing is perfect. We all have our imperfections and I think that is what makes things beautiful and unique.
