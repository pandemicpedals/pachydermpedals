This is the first of the Rullywow boards I started to put together. All parts were self sourced from Tayda Electronics, Mouser, Love My Switches, Pedalhacker Electronics, and more. It was not the first for me to paint. That actually came months later but it is one of my favorites to play. I really like the smooth mellow sounds I get out of this.

## Build Report ##

I didn't finish the art and the epoxy until 3 months after the pedal was built. The enclosure is a Tayda cream powder coat.

The look when originally finished. Was testing knob colors.

Used pencil, rulers and a compass to try to get nice even round design.

Pre-epoxy coat. I learned to pay attention to the washers for the pots. I no longer allow the sharp side to be down.

All shiny with the epoxy on. This is before re-drilling the holes to remove the epoxy. I had tried plugs in a previous pedal but the epoxy pulls up against the plug and makes divots around the knobs. I like the smooth surface that taping and filling the holes gives me.

I did not do a great job keeping the epoxy on the top. This is something I am still working on.

My first few pedal had the DC and jack labeling on the end. After the first 5 or 6 I stopped doing that.

I now label in/out/9v at the top. Here holes are drilled and it is ready to assemble.

This is the second pedal I soldered. I was still very new and I was using lead free solder. Leaded I learned is much easier to use.

Gut shot. After the first few pedals I stopped using the Madbean method of wiring the stomp and now use the PedalPCB method. I like the look better and find it easier.
