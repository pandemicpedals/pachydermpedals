title: "Pandemic Pedal #002"
excerpt: "This is the first of the Rullywow boards I started to put together. All parts were self sourced from Tayda Electronics, Mouser, Love My Switches, Pedalhacker Electronics, and more. It was not the first for me to paint. That actually came months later but it is one of my favorites to play. I really like the smooth mellow sounds I get out of this."
