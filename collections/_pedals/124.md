I will get images up soon but it is the same pedal and art as Pandemic Pedal #124. The only difference is that the LED is white and where the train light is and I used TL072 chip instead of the OPA2134. It gives it a little darker tone.

## Controls

From the [spec sheet](http://nebula.wsimg.com/b93a80acc190adf9a86f67bd5f88eaa3?AccessKeyId=15E3D289471B90FCC117&disposition=0&alloworigin=1):

* **GAIN**: Controls the overall input gain of unit
* **HI-CUT**: Provides a post OD high frequency cut ideal for amp tuning
* **VOLUME**: Controls the overall volume of the unit

### Switches

- **BRITE**: This circuit provides two levels of pre OD high frequency boost and an off setting. The degree of boost decreases
 as the GAIN control is increased.
  - **UP**: maximum boost. Adds extreme top end clarity and should be set to get best clean-up performance when
 using humbucker pickups.
  - **MIDDLE**: OFF, Flat Band Response
  - **DOWN**: Moderate boost ideal for adding sparkle to your tone.
- **VOICE**: Provides two distinct voices for the pedal post OD.
  - **UP**: Traditional Voice
  - **DOWN**: Modern British Voice
- **PRESENCE**: Provides three levels of post OD high frequency response. Ideal for matching the unit to your amp s top end
 response.
  - **UP**: maximum boost. Adds top end bite. Best used with dark amps or when going into a flat band power amp
  - **MIDDLE**: Flat frequency response
  - **DOWN**: Darkest setting used best with a bright amp
- **CAB**: Provides three modes ideal for matching the unit to your amp's low end response.
  - **UP**: 4x12 Adds extended low end boost
  - **MIDDLE**: OFF, Flat Band Response
  - **DOWN**: 2x12 Adds moderate low end boost
