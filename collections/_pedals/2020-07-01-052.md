# Pachyderm Pedals Test Bench w/ Audio Probe and Wave Generator #

First Self Modified Circuit Build! I wanted to create a test box with a wave generator. This is my first attempt. It still needs work. It has some grounding issues and the generator is super loud. The next iteration will include a volume know and the ability to use jacks as well as wires for debugging broken pedals. The audio probe is indispensable.
