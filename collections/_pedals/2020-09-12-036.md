excerpt: "I was going in a whole different direction with this. I have created a copper chainmail cover for this. I drew the large letters so they could be seen through the mail. I added big bold music clefs to add musicallity. Then I saw the transparent teal enclosure from small bear. That now gets the chainmail. This got some sparkles. The pedals sounds great though."
