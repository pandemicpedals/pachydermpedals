title: "Pandemic Pedal #030"
excerpt: "As soon as PedalPCB came out with the concept for this PCB I know I wanted to make a window for this pedal. When it arrived and I read the instructions I decided that I would make it an art piece. All the components are twisted to form the spikes on the virus. There is an always on blacklight LED in the pedal and a 10mm green LED to indication when it is active. This thing really glows on a pedalboard."
