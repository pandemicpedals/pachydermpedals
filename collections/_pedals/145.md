As part of this site is about mental health this art come from when mine is not doing well. I get this overwhelming hatred, for everything. It just boils up and all I can feel it HATE HATE HATE. It is such a simple feeling to hate. There are so many ways to do it. I feel like it is a copout, a waste. It is much harder to love, to see the flaws and differences in others and find the good. It is so difficult at times. And when my mental helth is on a down swing it is much much easier to hate. And to tell the truth I hate that as well. I would much rather understand, empathize, and love.
