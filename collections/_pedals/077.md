To me phasers make pretty sounds so I try to create pretty pedals. I had been watching some videos on different painting techniques and decided I would try a mandala. I believe that is what it's called. I love the way this looks. I make a mod to htis pedal. The little push button switch is suppsed to be internal, but I wanted it on the outside. I think it is like the EVH version of the Phase 90.
