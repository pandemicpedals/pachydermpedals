excerpt: "So the DLS is Catalinbread's Dirty Little Secret. Well that best friend..... He bragged about every one of his children to me before they were born. Except for the youngest. I found out from a Facebook post. I thought he had gottena new puppy. Instead it was Daddy's Little Secret. And she is the cutest little terror. This is a painting of her when she was dressing up as Harley Quinn. Very fitting."
