## Controls

* **Volume**
* **Dirt**
* **Bite**
* **Tight** - "The Tight knob does more than just tighten things up, it actually gives you a warmer, punchy and drier sound on the upper end and a more aggressive and in your face sound on the lower end. Think of it as a "Tightness Character" control. Keep this in mind as the ultra tight tone you want may not be at the maximum setting of the knob."
