This is the first pedal to get real paint, even before the talons, kot and eternity. I was worried about messing it up so I put tape ofer the entire enclosure. I drew and painted on the tape and put it together. It looked nice. I posted on reddit and they told me to just go for it. I am really glad I did.

### Concept Art

  <figcaption>Tape pencil drawing</figcaption>
</figure>

I got the idea for the artwork on this pedal from searching pharaoh vector on google images. I came across one that was very like this image and really liked it. I wanted to do a skull face and find that references make drawing easier. I had really never done anything like this before.

Because of that I was reloctant to just start painting on the pedal, and the copper hammer enclosure does not let me do a pencil outline first. Because this was my first time really trying to draw something I decided to cover the pedal with [gaffer tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZRYP38I), and draw on that. Once I had my sketch completed I poked holes through the tape and put the pedal back together to see how I liked the way it looked.

Since I was satisfied with the sketch and had some acrylic paint pens on hand, I decided to take the pedal apart and color in the tape to really get an idea of what it looked like. I made a [post to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals/comments/gjg8of/rullywow_king_tut_black_arts_toneworks_pharaoh/) with the tape pictures to see what people thought. I am really glad they gave me the encouragement to just go ahead and paint the pedals. Sometimes it just takes that little push from others to get you going on a new adventure.

### Painting the Enclosure

So I took several peoples advise and went ahead and painted on the enclosure. I made another [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals/comments/gpp0gq/finished_the_artwork_on_king_tut_fuzz_by_rullywow/) when it was complete.

1. I finally decided to start drawing on the enclosure itself. I used acrylic paint pens by [artistro from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D2LVYQZ).
2. Started Coloring. This is nerve wracking with shaky hands.
3. Skull almost done.
4. Hard to put detail into the snake.
5. I thought I was done with the coloring at this point. But in the final images you can see that I re-outlined almost everything.

### Finishing

The first image below is the obligatory gut shot. I think I am going to cut the leads on the transistors to make it look a little cleaner.

The next two are with it all done and assembled. I am glad I outlined things again. It helps define the shapes more. As you can see I outline the in and out arrows in black. I think I should have done the lettering as well. I used the Phoenician alphabet from wikipedia to indicate the controls.

Knob Left | Switches | Knob Right
---|---|---
(T)one  | Hi/Lo | (H)igh
(D)rive | Clip  | (L)evel (Since there is no V for Volume)

The third image shows the pedal with the indicator lights on.

### Final Thoughts

Though not designed for top mounted jack I am trying to get some consistency in the pedals I build. I used the extra space for the dual LEDs. The knobs do feel a little low in the enclosure. I still need to put the proper transistors in it. The build doc calls for 3 - 2n5089s. I have them on order from smallbear but have not yet received my order. I saw that the 2n5088 I had on hand can be used as a sub so that is what is in there now. For now it is finished and I am going to see what kinds of sounds I can get out of it.

**Note:** [Feb. 14, 2021] I really need to open this back up and check though I think they are changed now.

The pedal has a satin finish as I was following the finishing from [planetz](http://www.planetz.com/waterslide-decals/). I think in the future I am just going to clear coat a few times and then wax. I liked that look better. But this is a learning process. Hope you enjoy.

## Updates

**Note:** After finishing the pedal I found [gold switches](https://lovemyswitches.com/3pdt-latched-foot-switch-solder-lugs-gold/) at LoveMySwitches and decided I would upgrade the pedal to use these. I made a video of the process. I hope this is informative.

* **Tone**: full range tone control
* **High**: to replenish highs cut by the tone control
* **Si/Ge Switch**: Si for raspy distorted sound, asymmetric Ge for a more warm tubey old school sound
