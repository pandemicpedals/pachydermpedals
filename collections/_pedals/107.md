This is pedal 3 of the "Madbean Gauntlet". This is a clone of the original [BOSS DM-2 Delay](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/classic-gear-boss-dm-2). Another pedal with many trimmers, rare IC chips and a more complicated calibration process. It also had a switch that is PCB mount and not solder lug which I typically do not have on hand.

I made sure to take my time and source my parts from known sellers.

Some things to think about before working on something like this:

* 2 [MN3005](http://smallbear-electronics.mybigcommerce.com/mn3005-re-makes-xvive-audio/) $21.95 ea.
* 1 [MN3101](http://smallbear-electronics.mybigcommerce.com/ic-mn3101/) $7.95 ea.
* 1 [V571D](http://smallbear-electronics.mybigcommerce.com/ic-v571d/) $3.50 ea

This makes just these ICs cost $55.35 and that is without shipping. This is a costly pedal.
