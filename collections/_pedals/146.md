This enclosure had no pedal in mind when I drew it. I was at my brothers house and my sister-in-law has the most beautiful garden. I fell in love with the look of these leaves and just felt that I needed to paint them. They were in a planter near his pool. So as the kids swam in the middle of a heatwave I sat under an umbrella and went to town painting. I am really happy with the way it came out.
