excerpt: "The tube screamer. Everyone needs to build at least one. I did my first mods on this. The Rullywow design has jumpers for fat, bright, and something??. Instrad of letting them be jumpers I installed switches on the side for the fat and bright, a switch on the front for something. And I made another switch to change between TS9 and TS808. The lLED changes from red to green depending on which tube screamer."
