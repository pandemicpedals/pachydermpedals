What can I say? I have always wanted a Timmy since I started collecting pedals. When I saw this one I knew I had to do a tribute to Timmy from South Park. He is a strong character and never lets a disability get in his way. And he looks great. This is a really nice pedal.

## Build Report ##

This is the pedal where I learned that red acrylic paint when baked changes color. I believe what happens is that the red pigment is heavier so it sinks. I had to recolor in his shirt before clearcoating and applying epoxy. You can still see some of the discoloration in the title. My friend [CassianJanay](https://www.etsy.com/shop/cassianjanay) sewed up the beautiful bags that I will send the pedals out in if I ever get around to selling any.
