title: "Pandemic Pedal #025"
excerpt: "This was inspired by my daughter. She had just started painting and she was doing flowers. I really liked them so this pedal was perfect as a tribute to her. I like using the knobs as the flower centers and the led is a ladybug on the leaf. The spider in the lower right is to cover a chip I got in the enclosure."
