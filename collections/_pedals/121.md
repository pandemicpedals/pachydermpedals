I've wanted one of these Diezel pedals for a while. Just never got around to buying one of each overdrive. Can you image trying to accomplish that feat? One thing about building pedals though is that you can get there a little easier. So I am not building my way through every pedal I possibly can. But I am a completionist and I am afraid I will be disappointed in the end. But I will have fun as I try.

This pedal will have to remain in this semi finished state. It serves it's purpose right now. But I will beed to get by CNC laser up and running so I can try new things. Alas... yet again I need to wait until I have more room to work.

## Thoughts

I really hope that laser is strong enough to burn through the black.
