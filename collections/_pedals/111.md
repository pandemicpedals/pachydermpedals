This is the final pedal of my Madbean Gauntlet. This is the most difficult one that he has available.

## Thoughts

This is the Zeus build on the Madbean projects page. I took it very slowly building this pedal.

## Controls

* **Delay** - Total delay time from slap-back to approximately 550ms
* **FDBK** - The total number of repeats from one to many to self-oscillation
* **Level** - The input gain of the circuit. This control can create mild overdrive when turned up
* **Blend** - The dry/wet ratio of guitar and delay
* **Mod** - The depth of modulation applied to the delay signal (The modulation rate is fixed)
* **CH/VB** - This switches between chorus and vibrato type modulation
