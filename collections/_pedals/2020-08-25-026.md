excerpt: "When I looked up the original for this one all I saw was racing stripes. I liked that. A good friend had a yellow Camaro Super Sport back in the day,  so I decided to go with that look. I tried my best to recreate the super sport logo and there is even the super sport script  on the bottom spelling \"Super Six\"."
