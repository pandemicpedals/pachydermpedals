## Build Report ##

Got some help from the PedalPCB forum to add an indicator light for the LFO rate. I really like this mod and this pedal. I have a Grand Orbiter and have done a quick comparison (They are almost identical to my ear). I need to get the videos online but everything will happen in time. Full story will have more details of my troubles with this paint job.

### Art Attempt ###

I did the art on this pedal several time. I even baked it more than once. This is when I learned that the red pigment will sink if I bake the pedal too long or at too high a heat. After the third image I taped off the area I wanted to be in white and used a primer for the white background. It was able to cover the mistakes I had made with the acrylic paint pens.

The second picture shows the modification that I made. Chuck D. Bones on the PedalPCB forum showed me how to install a [LFO LED](https://forum.pedalpcb.com/threads/i-would-like-to-add-a-lfo-led-to-the-circulator-reposting-here-because-i-think-this-is-more-fitting.3024/). It was as easy as installing an LED from pin 8 on IC3. I am thankful for all the help and knowledge I receive from the people there.

### Good Enough ###

I finally decided to just do the labels in sharpie and epoxy over them. I think if I were to build this pedal again I would try to create more original artwork. I am still torn about making things that look close to the original. It really is just me being lazy and wanting to use the pedal before I can think of some art. In the future I think I will just box them and rock them without art if I am unsure what I want to do.

### Assembly ###

This is one of the first that I tried to epoxy a side. Not sure how I like it. It is also one of the last that I added the labels near the jacks. I had origninally finished this the same way as the Pharoah. I did not like the satin finish. I had the brilliant (i.e. terrible) idea that I could bake it off. That is what you see running down the inside in picture 2 below. Thankfully it all worked out in the end.

### Complete ###

Here it is all shined up and working. If is a remarkable copy of the real thing. It was the first PedalPCB pedal that I put together because I did not want to wait for my order from Earthquaker Devices to come in. Once it did I played them side by side and was very satisfied. I will put up a demo one day with a comparison.
