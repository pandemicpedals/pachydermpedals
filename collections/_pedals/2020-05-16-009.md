excerpt: "Got some help from the PedalPCB forum to add an indicator light for the LFO rate. I really like this mod and this pedal. I have a Grand Orbiter and have done a quick comparison (They are almost identical to my ear). I need to get the videos online but everything will happen in time. Full story will have more details of my troubles with this paint job."
