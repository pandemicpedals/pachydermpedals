I do not have this pedal any more as it was my first and as of Febuary 2021 only sale. Sold to a friend that I have played "The Last of Us: Factions" with for years. He loves the sound of it. His has a yinyang like the original. I was really happy with the way this came out. I used a compass to try to make really nice circles. It is also one of the few pedals that I have not done epoxy on, just clear coat.
