This is the boneyard edition of the PedalPCB Delegate Compressor. It incorporates the mods as described by Check D Bones on the Pedal PCB Forum in [this thread](https://forum.pedalpcb.com/threads/delegate-warden-upgrades.3044/). It is a very good read and I would recommend going over and reading about the changes and why they were made.

## Controls

From the Earthquaker Devices site:

* **Tone**: This pedal was designed to slightly color your tone, and the coloration can be dialed-in to your taste. Counterclockwise is treble cut, clockwise is treble boost. The tone is nearly flat around 11 oâ€™clock.
* **Attack**: This controls how quickly the compressor reacts and starts leveling the signal. All the way counterclockwise is a fast, nearly immediate reaction. Turning the attack clockwise slows the reaction time.
* **Release**: This controls how long it takes the signal to raise back up to the level determined by the **Sustain** and ***Ratio*** settings. All the way counterclockwise is a fast release and the release time slows as you turn it clockwise.
* **Level**: This controls the overall output and is affected by the **Sustain** and **Ratio** settings. There is no specific unity setting; adjust to taste when you find your perfect compression setting.
* **Ratio**: This determines how much the gain reduction affects the signal. All the way up is full compression and the compression is reduced as you turn this counterclockwise which allows more of the boosted, less-compressed signal to come through. There are no defined ratios here.
* **Sustain**: This is the heart of The Warden. It controls how hot the signal is, which changes the dynamics of the compression. The Warden is a feedback-style compressor; the hotter the signal, the more active the compression. Very little **Sustain**= very little compression, less active **Attack** and **Release** and a cooler signal. Max **Sustain**= heavy compression, longer sustain, hotter signal and more lively **Attack** and **Release**.
