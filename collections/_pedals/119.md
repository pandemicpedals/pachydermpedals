This is my third build. It is officially prototype number 2. I still do not like the colors that came out. I made a mistake on the shite layer and it came out gray. I do like the way it looks with the LED in the eye socket. I have also found how I am going to make it flicker and fade. So this one may change a little as I put that together and test it. I may integrate it into the board and make my own PCB. We will have to see.

## Thoughts

I am liking the direction this is taking. I hope the LED part of the circuit doesn't add noise in the future.

## Controls

From the [solodallas shop](https://solodallas-shop.com/products/storm-d-2019):

* **GAIN** knob controls our signature gain circuit that bumps the crucial low-mid frequencies responsible for giving live instruments punch and making them stand out in the mix (think Angus Young guitar tone).
* **BOOST** knob controls a powerful pre-amp capable of delivering a whopping 31db of clean boost. This analog boost is perfect for making lead parts stand out, adding fullness to the signal going into the front end of your amplifier or pushing it into oblivion!
* **LIMITER** knob controls Ken Schafferâ€™s signature Opto-Isolator limiter. This optical analog circuit naturally limits the audio signal going into the pedal's circuitry (unlike the complimentary compander circuit which smooths out amplitude after the signal reaches its peak). Limiting is commonly used by mastering engineers to transparently raise overall level, without the risk of clipping and distortion generally associated with gain increases. Sensitivity of this effect may be fine tuned for different output pickups or to give your instrument an open or compressed attack.
