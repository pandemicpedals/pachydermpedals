I just wanted a place to put the amplifiers that I currently have to use. This may actually become an equipment page. Ideally I would like to start doing live streams. Not so people can hear my playing but tso that they can see what DIY pedals sound like. I would like people to be able to hear what it might possibly sound like on their equipment.

## Guitar Amps

### Marshall JCM800

This is a mid 1980s JCM800 half stack. I could give the exact date if I wanted to go find the receipt. This was my first amp. 

My starting equipment I now realize was better than I ever had any right owning. I got them because I had gone through a window at a gootball camp and ended up with a little money to spend. I also got a pinky on my fretting hand that I couldn't feel or control. I will tell you. I would have reather had shit equipment and a working hand. I was finally able to start to using my pinky in my mid 40s and now in my early 50s have a little more control. I still can't really feel if I am touching an adjacent string.

I have been dragging this Marshall across the country with me for more than 35 years. I've had the head fly out of a car I rolled end over end in Ohio when traveling from NY to San Fransisco. I am really happy to still have it because I do not have any of the guitars from that time. 

### Mezzabarba Skill30

I know in the previous section I stated I am in my 50s. Well I also just graduated from college. The skill 30 was a present to myself after working for a year at the job I got out of college. It is never too late to learn. I had my Marshall in the house but it is not a modern metal amp. I didn't really have many pedals at the time (unlike now). So I wanted a new amp.

I had been going to the [Axe Palace](https://axepalace.com/) in Walpole and had been introduced to many new amps and sounds. This was one of my favorites. About 6 months after getting the amp I picked up the ENGL 2X12 with vintage 30s. I love the sound of this amp and most of the pedals in my shorts are through the clean channel.

After the purchases at Axe Palace I got a job a a big music instrument retailer for the weekends. The discounts are great and that is where I picked up the Mesa Boogie 2X12, also with vintage 30s. It had come in used and I just had to pick it up. The Mesa Boogie and ENGL both have a unique sound that belnds really well. They are piggybacked out of the Captor 16 for attentuation. 

### Fender Blues Jr

The retail job also allowed me to get all the rest of the guitars and pedals that I own. One of the things I purchased was a Fender Blues Jr to try to get some more classic guitar tones. Not just banging out metal riffs all the time. 

This is now the second most played amp I have. I need to get it out of that corner. I think I would use it more often if I was able to get to it a little easier.

## Bass Amp

### Markbass Little Mark 250

When I know that my time at the retail store was coming towards an end my boss kept me on as long as possible so that I would have a change to purchase everything I wanted with my discounts. One of those things was this bass rig. Its a nice little amp. A 2X10 and a 1X15 cabinet. This is what I play all the bass through.
