This is a work in progress. I should probably stage it but I like to have information available.
{: .notice--warning }

# Introduction

I've seen this come up a few times from beginners about where to start. Since I have only been at this since March of 2020 I thought I would put together a list of what I had found useful. I will try to organize is as best I can and I will continue to update this page as I find more useful things. If a section gets too big I may break it out and make it its own page. 

The best thing you can do is explore and read. I will put up a few sites here but I am sure there are others. Another great resource is youtube. I use it to give me tutorials on soldering and using equipment.

# Information

Read the forums on the side bar. It is also nice to buy PCB boards from  places that have forums as well. [PedalPCB](https://forum.pedalpcb.com/) has a really good forum and they are very responsive. [Rullywow](https://rullywow.com/) got back to me right away when I had questions. [Aion Electronics](https://aionfx.com/) and [Mad Bean Pedals](https://www.madbeanpedals.com/projects/index.html) both have very informative documentation. And watch [Wampler's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdVrg4Wl3vjIxonABn6RfWw), he goes over a lot of stuff about the circuits and how they work. I just started in March, 2020 and have read a lot. 

You can also learn a lot from [Guitar FX Layouts](http://tagboardeffects.blogspot.com/) and [Effects Layouts](http://effectslayouts.blogspot.com/). Other good sites for learning are
