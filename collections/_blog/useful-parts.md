This is a work in progress. I should probably stage it but I like to have information available.
(: .notice--warning )

# Introduction

I've seen this come up a few times from beginners about where to start. Since I have only been at this a couple of month's I thought I would put together a list of what I had found. 

**Note:** This will be very US centric since that is where I am getting parts and PCBs from.
{: .notice--info }

These are some of the parts I like to use and where I get them from. 

# Parts

* **[LEDs](https://amzn.to/3aJH7wR)** - I really like these and have a good results with them for the price. Plus the colors are nice
* **[Potentiometer Dust Cover](https://amzn.to/3bAyUu6)** - To avoiding shorting potentiometers on the back of the board.
* **[Wire](https://amzn.to/3khYs33)** - This 24 awg solid core wire has worked really well so far for me. I also like their [22 awg solid core wires](https://amzn.to/3bzI61L) for off board components because I get better control of how the wire bends.
* **[Connectors](https://amzn.to/37IuHTZ)** - These have made my life so much easier. It allows me to connect and disconnet the DC jack so I can take the board back out of the enclosure without having to desolder.
