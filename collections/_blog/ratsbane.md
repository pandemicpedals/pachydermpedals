I picked up one of [Wampler's Ratsbane](https://amzn.to/3kUEpbb) pedals after seeing his [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAt-hgqrocI) about it. In the video he talks about the fact that he socketed the opamp so that people could try different opamps in the circuit.

## The OpAmps

I decided to see if there was any difference between the single opamps I had on hand. The following opamps are in this comparison:

* TL071 - This is the opamp that came with the pedal
* LM741 - Probably best known (at least by me) for being in the MXR distortion +
* LM741 Tin Can - A metal can version of the LM741
* LM308 - This is the opamp in the original Rat circuit
* NE5534 - It worked, that's why I tried it. I believe it is a lower noise opamp
* OPA134 - These I believe are also supposedly of better quality and lower noise.
