Let me start off by saying I love the PedalPCB community. The forum is an excellent place to get help, show off, and talk about pedals and building. I would classify pedalPCB as being more for the intermediate and above pedal builder. I believe that most of the board are based on traces that they have done themselves. They are meant to be accurate representations of the pedals they are compared to. 

The documentaion has the basics:

* Picture of board
* Parts and location
* Schematic
* Wiring diagram
* Drill template

There is no writeup about the pedal. You will not even get what is it a clone of, you will beed to go to the site for that. Part sourcing and/or substitution are also not in the document, you will have to check the forum. You will also periodically get a "look at the data sheet". And while some might see that as harsh... it is really good advice and I have learned more from looking up datasheets and searching google to answer my own questions.

The people on the board are great at helping out as well, and Mr. PedalPCB is very helpful and open to suggestions (like putting the labels on the drill template so I know how to label my bulds, thank you).

**PedalPCB** is in no way associated with Pandemic Pedals or Pachyderm Pedals I just like his products.
