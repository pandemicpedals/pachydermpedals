I had put together a tutorial on designing a test box for my builds. You can see it [here](/tutorials/2021-02-09-test-box/).

I had some question on how I use it. When I found that my snarkdoodle was not working correctly I decided to create a video of me fixing it. This is the video I recorded. I had tried to edit it into a tutorial but its not. This is me using it and a digital multimeter to figure out why my Madbean Pedals Snarkdoodle was not working. In the end I solved the problem. I hope you enjoy.
