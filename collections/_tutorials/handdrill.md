I had just received some UV printed enclosures from Tayda Electronics and I wanted to make a video of me finishing them. I make some mistakes along the way but they are easily fixed. Becareful when hand drilling your enclosures. You are at much greater risk of hurting yourself. If a bit catches the metal you can get seriously hurt. Because of that:

**WARNING**: Do not try this at home. Always properly secure the enclosure that you are drilling and keep your hands and other body parts clear.
