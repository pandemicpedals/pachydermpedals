This is the place where I will put templates that I hope will help people build and produce art for their pedals. All you have to do is right lick on the links and "Save link as...".

## Knob Surrounds

This has a collection of knob surrounds with common knob sizes. You will need to resize the surround for the size of knob you are using.

## Common DIY Pedal Templates

Added layers are:

* **BACKGROUND:** This is just a background. I try to set it to an approximation of the enclosure color I will have.
* **HOLES:** These are the holes that you would need to drill. The outer layers are for pots the inner for switches. In the LED location they are 3mm and 5mm.
* **KNOBS:** These are circles that are 15mm and 19mm which seem to be the most common knob sizes for this layout of controls.

### PedalPCB

PedalPCB has 2 main templates for most of his 125B pedals. They are a wider and a narrower version of the same thing. I call them large and small. I will work on getting templates up for the rest of his builds over time.

#### 125B Large

</figure>

This is the starting template I use for many [PedalPCB](https://www.pedalpcb.com) build. This includes the WHITE, COLOR and GLOSS layers for [Tayda UV Printing](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/hardware/enclosures/enclosure-uv-printing-service.html) on a 125B enclosure. You will need to remove the other layers before sending it to them.
