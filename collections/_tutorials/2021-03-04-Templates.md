# Introduction

This is the place where I will put templates that I hope will help people build and produce art for their pedals.

## Knob Surrounds

<figure  style="width: 200px" class="align-left">
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resources/PedalGraphicItems.jpg"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resources/PedalGraphicItems.jpg" alt=""></a>
</figure>

This has a collection of knob surrounds with common knob sizes. You will need to resize the surround for the size of knob you are using.
