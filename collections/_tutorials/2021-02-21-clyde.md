## Introducing Clyde

If you look through my site and put things together you may deduce that I am somewhere in my 50s. Even so, I graduated from college a few years ago in my late 40s. After graduation I still had not received any offers for employment. From talking to classmates that had accepted offers at places I interviewed, I found out that "recent college grad" with 20 years experience does not compute for many employers. As the summer wore on I finally got an offer, accepted, and just had to wait for process to finalize so I could move.

During this time I stayed with my parents at a retirement community in Arizona. My mother spent much of her time at the clay studio there and I was enjoying handing out with her. Me, being the metal head I am decided I would make a skull with a chunk of clay my mother gave me. I am not sure how that looked to a bunch of septua- and octogenarians, but that is how Clyde was born.

## Forming Clyde ##

This is what Clyde looked like right after I was done forming him.

## Drying ##

This is a week later after he was dry and ready to go in the kiln. I did rub him down a little to get rid of the rough spots.

## Clyde Complete ##

I looked at sime pictures of old skulls to try and decide hot to paint him. I noticed that even though the teeth are often rotten in spots, some areas are still pearly white. The glaze used for the skull itself was called oatmeal and I think it did well to get the texture I wanted. I am happy with how he came out. 

He is always with me when I work. I even had him in my office until the pandemic started. My office mate found him kind of strange. :grin:
